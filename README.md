# üåê HADR Project on AWS

## üìå Overview
The **HADR Project** (High Availability and Disaster Recovery) is designed to demonstrate a highly available, fault-tolerant, and resilient architecture for hosting a website using **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.  
The setup ensures minimal downtime and efficient failover between two AWS regions ‚Äî **Mumbai** (Primary) and **Virginia** (Secondary).

## üèó Architecture & Implementation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ VPC Creation
- Created a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** with:
  - **Public Subnet** (Internet-accessible)
  - **Private Subnet** (Internal workloads)
- Added a **NAT Gateway** in the public subnet to allow outbound internet access from the private subnet.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ EC2 Instances
- Launched **two EC2 instances**:
  - **Public Subnet Instance** ‚Äì Accessible over the internet.
  - **Private Subnet Instance** ‚Äì Accessed via SSH tunneling through the public instance.
  
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Website Deployment
- Deployed the **website** on the **private instance**.
- Configured **NGINX** on the **public instance** (Ubuntu) as a reverse proxy to serve website content.
- Modified the NGINX server block to allow access via the public IP.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ NAT Gateway Removal
- After setup completion, removed the **NAT Gateway** to optimize costs.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ AMI & Launch Template
- Created an **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** of the public instance.
- Built a **Launch Template** using this AMI.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
- Created an **Auto Scaling Group** from the launch template.
- Attached the ASG to an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** for efficient load distribution.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Replication in Secondary Region
- Replicated the **entire infrastructure** in the **US-East (Virginia)** region for disaster recovery.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ DNS Configuration
- Created a **Hosted Zone** in Route 53.
- Added **CNAME records** with **Failover Routing Policy**:
  - **Primary:** Mumbai infrastructure
  - **Secondary:** Virginia infrastructure
